# SubSpace Features Brainstorming

This document captures ideas and concepts for SubSpace-specific features that differentiate it from the base Naev game. These are brainstorming ideas and not all will necessarily be implemented.

## Core Theme: SubSpace

The defining feature of our game is the **SubSpace** concept - an alternate dimensional plane that allows for unique gameplay mechanics.
